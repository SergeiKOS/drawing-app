## Description

Drawing app project for the Mintbean hackathon. In this app, you can pick width (separate between line and eraser), pick a color (and close it by pressing on ESC button or anywhere in canvas), and draw lines, and the eraser also works on touch devices too. Due to time limitations, there is not a lot in terms of features.
